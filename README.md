# conversion_to_polaroid

After watched Dune Part Two, I wanted to make a simple and basic conversion to polaroid form project that only takes the picture as input so that I could keep my favorite pictures of the actors in polaroid form.

There are 3 functions that I don't need to keep as a separate file, but the reason I added them this way is to create them while I learn how to do them. They are:

-gray_scale.py

-pixel_dimensions.py

-image.cut.py

-------
If you have an image with a large horizontal length, for example "reverend mother 2.jpg" in the polaroid_horizontal file, you can run to_polaroid_horizontal.py in the polaroid_horizontal folder. Its general purpose is to convert the image to polaroid by halving its width.

-------
If you have an image with more vertical length or a square image, for example "lea seydoux f.jpg" in the polaroid_vertical file, you can run to_polaroid_vertical.py in the polaroid_vertical folder.
