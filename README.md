# conversion_to_polaroid

After watched Dune Part Two, I wanted to make a simple and basic conversion to polaroid form project that only takes the picture as input so that I could keep my favorite pictures of the actors in polaroid form.

There are 2 functions that I don't need to keep as a separate file, but the reason I added them this way is to create them while I learn how to do them. They are:

-gray_scale.py

-pixel_dimensions.py

-------
If you have an image with more horizontal length, for example "reverend mother 2.jpg" you can run the to_polaroid1.py file in the polaroid1.0 folder. Its general purpose is to convert the image to polaroid by halving its width.

-------
If you have an image with more vertical length or a square image, for example "lea seydoux f.jpg" you can run the to_polaroid2.py file in the polaroid2.0 folder.
