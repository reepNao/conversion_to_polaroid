# conversion_to_polaroid

After watched Dune Part Two, I wanted to make a simple and basic conversion to polaroid form project that only takes the picture as input so that I could keep my favorite pictures of the actors in polaroid form.

There are 2 functions that I don't need to keep as a separate file, but the reason I added them this way is to create them while I learn how to do them. 
They are:


-gray_scale.py
-pixel_dimensions.py
